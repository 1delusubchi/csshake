The smart templates method uses artificial intelligence to train custom Excel templates that can identify and select the tables you want from your PDF files.
 
With smart templates, you can automate your PDF to Excel conversions and save time on repetitive tasks. You can also use master templates to batch convert multiple PDFs with similar table structures in one go.
